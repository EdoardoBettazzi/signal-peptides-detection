### Abstract 
Amino-terminal signal peptides (SPs) are short regions that guide the targeting 
of secretory proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in the cell. Detecting their 
presence in protein sequences can provide useful information about subcellular localization, 
a key feature in the process of functional annotation. Since the common structure of SPs has 
been known for a long time, several methods have been developed, employing very different 
approaches for the detection of signal peptides. Here, we present a comparison between two 
common approaches: we developed a position-specific weight matrix (PSWM) model based 
on the method by (von Heijne, 1986) and a supervised learning model based on Support 
Vector Machines (SVMs). The models were then trained and evaluated on the SignalP-5.0 
datasets by (Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019). Results indicate that the SVM-based model outperforms the PSWM-based 
model in the detection of SPs, with an MCC of 0.612 against an MCC of 0.582.
